This marks the end of the original codebase that started Xylon Engine. When I first wrote this, it was a foundation—far from perfect, but an important first step in bringing this project to life. Over time, as the vision for the engine became clearer, so did the need for a stronger, more efficient architecture.

Now, it's time to move forward. The new version will be built from the ground up, integrating Sokol, SDL2, and other technologies still under consideration. This rewrite isn’t just about improving performance or adding features—it’s about refining the core principles of the engine, making it more robust, scalable, and efficient.

With this commit, I’m merging the old code into the main branch, closing the chapter on what got Xylon Engine off the ground. It served its purpose well, but the future demands something better.

Onward to the next stage.
